## 📌 Overview

**Sleep360** bridges the gap between **sleep science** and **student academic performance**. Students submit their sleep and lifestyle data through an interactive form with a **live prediction preview**, and the system runs a custom **multi-factor weighted model** to:

- 📊 Predict attendance percentage from 8 sleep & lifestyle inputs
- 🚨 Classify attendance shortage risk as **High / Moderate / Low**
- 😴 Assess chronic fatigue risk with actionable health recommendations
- 📈 Generate a personal **Sleep Score (0–100)**
- 🔮 Show a **Trend Projection** — how habits changes would improve attendance
- 📐 Break down each **Factor's Impact** on attendance (e.g. Late Sleep: −8.0%)
- 👥 Compare cohort-level data across **4 age bands** (14–17, 17–19, 20–22, 23+)
- 🔬 Display a **Research Dashboard** with Pearson r = 0.78 sleep-vs-attendance correlation

## 🧠 Machine Learning Engine

Sleep360's engine is a **transparent, explainable model** — every weight has a scientific justification, making it ideal for portfolio and academic discussion.

### Attendance Prediction Formula

```
attendance_score = 50
  + (sleep_duration − 4) × 4.0    →  Sleep Duration:    +4.0% per extra hour
  + sleep_quality × 1.5            →  Sleep Quality:     subjective rating weight
  + deep_sleep_percentage × 0.3    →  Deep Sleep %:      +0.3% per 1% deep sleep
  − sleep_timing × 8.0             →  Late Sleep:        −8.0% penalty
  + study_hours × 2.0              →  Study Hours:       +2.0% per hour
  − screen_time × 1.5              →  Screen Time:       −1.5% per hour
  + physical_activity × 0.8        →  Physical Activity: +0.8% per hour/week
  − (stress_level − 5) × 1.2       →  Stress Level:      −1.2% above baseline
```

### Algorithms & Models

| Component | Method |
|---|---|
| **Attendance Prediction** | Weighted Linear Scoring (custom, fully explainable) |
| **Risk Classification** | Multi-threshold classifier (≥85% Low / 75–84% Moderate / <75% High) |
| **Fatigue Assessment** | Rule-based additive scoring (6 behavioural signal flags) |
| **Sleep Score** | Composite weighted formula (3 components → 0–100 scale) |
| **Trend Projection** | Scenario simulation: +10pt and +22pt improvement paths |
| **Cohort Analytics** | Segmented group aggregation with Pearson r correlation |
